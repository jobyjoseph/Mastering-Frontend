Define Navigation Paths - https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-android-training-add-navigation/index.html

> Navigation destinations are fragments, activities, or other app components that the user navigates to. A navigation graph defines the possible paths from one navigation destination to the next.

> A navigation host fragment, usually named NavHostFragment, acts as a host for the fragments in the navigation graph.

Start an External Activity - https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-android-training-start-external-activity/index.html

> To help catch errors caused by missing keys or mis-matched types when you pass data from one fragment to another, use a Gradle plugin called _Safe Args_.

> An implicit intent declares an action that your app wants some other app (such as a camera app or email app) to perform on its behalf.

> To add an options menu to a fragment, set the `setHasOptionsMenu()` method to `true` in the fragment code.
